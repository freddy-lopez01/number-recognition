# number-recognition
pytorch ml model trained to recognize hand written numbers from the torchvision MNIST datasets  


## Training Approach 

Pull the training and test data from the dataset and convert data to tensors 

Training dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 pixels images with no RGB color values associated with the images 

Testing dataset consists of 10,000 28x28 pixels images also with no RGB color values associated with the images 

Images classes consist of the images with the numbers 1-9
